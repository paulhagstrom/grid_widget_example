This is a demonstration/testbed for the grid_widget plugin for Apotomo/jqGrid (Rails 3)

https://github.com/paulhagstrom/grid_widget

To make the example go:

git clone git://github.com/paulhagstrom/grid_widget_example.git
cd grid_widget_example
git submodule init
git submodule update
bundle install
rake db:reset
rails s

browse to http://localhost:3000/authors

I will probably be updating this more often than I update the readme, but I will try
to keep it in sync with the plugin.

It demonstrates at least how to embed one GridEditWidget inside another one's form,
and how to set various options, use filters, etc.  In lieu of much real documentation.
